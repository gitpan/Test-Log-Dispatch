NAME
    Test::Log::Dispatch -- Test what you are logging

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::More;
        use Test::Log::Dispatch;

        my $log = Test::Log::Dispatch->new();

        # ...
        # call something that logs to $log
        # ...

        # now test to make sure you logged the right things

        $log->contains_ok(qr/good log message/);
        $log->does_not_contain_ok(qr/unexpected log message/);
        $log->empty_ok();

        # or

        my $msgs = $log->msgs;
        cmp_deeply($msgs, ['msg1', 'msg2', 'msg3']);

DESCRIPTION
    `Test::Log::Dispatch' is a `Log::Dispatch' object that keeps track of
    everything logged to it in memory, and provides convenient tests against
    what has been logged.

CONSTRUCTOR
    The constructor returns a `Test::Log::Dispatch' object, which inherits
    from `Log::Dispatch' and contains a single `Log::Dispatch::Array' output
    at 'debug' level.

    The constructor requires no parameters. Any parameters will be forwarded
    to the `Log::Dispatch::Array' constructor. For example, you can pass a
    *min_level* to override the default 'debug'.

METHODS
    contains_ok ($regex, $test_name)
        Tests that a message in the log buffer matches *$regex*. On success,
        the message is *removed* from the log buffer (but any other matches
        are left untouched).

    does_not_contain_ok ($regex, $test_name)
        Tests that no message in the log buffer matches *$regex*.

    empty_ok ($test_name)
        Tests that there is no log buffer left.

    contains_only_ok ($regex, $test_name)
        Tests that there is a single message in the log buffer and it
        matches *$regex*. On success, the message is removed.

    clear ()
        Clears the log buffer.

    msgs ()
        Returns the current contents of the log buffer as an array
        reference, where each element is a hash containing a *message* and
        *level* key.

TO DO
    *   Allow testing of log levels.
